Comprehensive plan for creating a fantasy football and sports betting scoreboard with some exciting features! Here's a quick summary of what you're aiming to achieve:

    Overall Objective:
        Create a dynamic scoreboard that displays fantasy football and sports betting information.
        Utilize Firebase Realtime Database for real-time data updates.

    Fantasy Football Features:
        Populate data from the app onto the scoreboard.
        Display matchups, teams, scoring, and transactions for fantasy football leagues.
        Use the user ID to filter and track individual teams across different leagues.
        Implement real-time updates for player scores and switch the scoreboard accordingly.
        Allow configuration in the app for the frequency of scoreboard switches.

    User Interface:
        Explore screen options compatible with Raspberry Pi to display the scoreboard.
        Keep costs under $200 for the entire setup.

    App Control:
        Develop an app to control scoreboard settings.
        Configure the frequency of scoreboard changes.
        Provide options for switching between Sleeper and ESPN leagues.

    Notifications and Alerts:
        Display notifications at the top of the scoreboard for trade alerts, transactions, and upset alerts.
        Implement a visually appealing point update notification when players score.

    Universal Platform:
        Create a universal platform that integrates data from Sleeper and potentially ESPN.
        Project matchup and betting data on the scoreboard.

    Future Man Cave Integration:
        Plan for future integration into a man cave setting for an enhanced viewing experience.

    Cost Considerations:
        Aim to keep the overall cost of the project under $200.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Regular Commits:

    As you make changes to your code, regularly commit those changes to your local repository. A good commit captures a meaningful chunk of work. Use descriptive commit messages to explain what changes were made and why. For example:

    git add .
    git commit -m "Add new feature X"

### Pushing Changes:

    Periodically, you should push your local commits to GitHub to keep your remote repository up-to-date. This is typically done at natural stopping points in your work, like at the end of the day or after completing a feature or fixing a bug:

    git push origin main

### Pull Before Pushing (when switching from machine to machine):

    If you're working in a team or using multiple devices, always pull the latest changes from GitHub before starting your work session and before pushing new changes:

    git pull origin main

This ensures you're working with the most recent version of the code and helps prevent merge conflicts.
